### Installation

Install necessary dependencies (unless you have them already). Example for Debian / Raspbian:

        sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool libglib2.0-dev pkg-config

##### RTLSDR support (optional)

Install `librtlsdr` library (unless you have it already). Under Raspbian you can install packaged version:

        apt-get install librtlsdr-dev

or get the source from Git and compile by hand:

        apt-get install git autoconf libusb-1.0-0-dev
        cd
        git clone git://git.osmocom.org/rtl-sdr.git
        cd rtl-sdr/
        autoreconf -i
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install
        sudo ldconfig
        sudo cp $HOME/rtl-sdr/rtl-sdr.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/rtl-sdr.rules

##### Mirics support (optional)

libmirisdr-4 is an open-source alternative to SDRPlay binary driver (Mirics is the
chipset brand which SDRPlay RSPs are based on). However, as of December 2017, it works
properly with RSP1 only. For other RSP types (RSP2, RSP/1A) gain control does not
work too well, so the native closed source driver is a better option (see next section).
libmirisdr-4 is a good choice for RSP1 and various Mirics-based DVB-T dongles which
are detected as RSP1 device. An advantage over RSP binary API is lower CPU utilization
in dumpvdl2 thanks to a lower sampling rate.

Install `libmirisdr-4` library:

        apt-get install git cmake libusb-1.0-0-dev
        cd
        git clone https://github.com/f4exb/libmirisdr-4.git
        cd libmirisdr-4
        ./build.sh
        cd build
        sudo make install
        sudo ldconfig
        sudo cp $HOME/libmirisdr-4/mirisdr.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/mirisdr.rules

##### SDRPLAY RSP1/2 support (optional)

Download and install API/hardware driver package from http://www.sdrplay.com/downloads/.
Make sure you have selected the right hardware platform before downloading, otherwise
the installer will fail.

##### Compiling dumpvdl2

Download a stable release package from [here](https://github.com/szpajder/dumpvdl2/releases)
or clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/szpajder/dumpvdl2.git
        cd dumpvdl2

If you only need RTLSDR support, it is enabled by default, so just type:

        make

Mirics support has to be explicitly enabled, like this:

        make WITH_MIRISDR=1

If you only need Mirics or SDRPlay, you may disable RTLSDR support:

        make WITH_MIRISDR=1 WITH_RTLSDR=0

or:

        make WITH_SDRPLAY=1 WITH_RTLSDR=0

**Note:** every time you decide to recompile with different `WITH_*` or `USE_*` options,
clean the old build first using `make clean`.

To list available command line options, run:

        ./dumpvdl2 --help

##### Optional: add support for statistics

Install `statsd-c-client` library from https://github.com/romanbsd/statsd-c-client:

        git clone https://github.com/romanbsd/statsd-c-client.git
        cd statsd-c-client
        make
        sudo make install
        sudo ldconfig

Compile dumpvdl2 as above, but add `USE_STATSD=1`:

        make USE_STATSD=1

### Basic usage

##### RTL-SDR

Simplest case on RTLSDR dongle - uses RTL device with index 0, sets the tuner gain to
40 dB and tuning correction to 42 ppm, listens to the default VDL2 frequency of 136.975 MHz,
outputs to standard output:

        ./dumpvdl2 --rtlsdr 0 --gain 40 --correction 42

Device ID numbers are not persistent - they depend on the USB device order and the sequence
which they were plugged in. You may specify the device by its serial number to get deterministic
behavior:

        ./dumpvdl2 --rtlsdr 771111153 --gain 40 --correction 42

Use rtl_test utility to get serial numbers of your devices. dumpvdl2 will print them to
the screen on startup as well.

If you want to decode another VDL2 channel, just add its frequency as a last parameter:

        ./dumpvdl2 --rtlsdr 0 --gain 40 --correction 42 136725000

dumpvdl2 can decode up to 8 VDL2 channels simultaneously. Just list their frequencies at the end
of the command line:

        ./dumpvdl2 --rtlsdr 0 --gain 40 --correction 42 136725000 136975000 136875000

If your receiver has a large center spike, you can set the center frequency a bit to the side
of the desired channel frequency, like this:

        ./dumpvdl2 --rtlsdr 0 --gain 40 --correction 42 --centerfreq 137100000 <channel freqs here...>

##### Mirics

Mirics is similar, however `libmirisdr-4` library currently lacks support for configuring
correction in ppm. If your receiver needs a non-zero correction, you can pass the appropriate
value in Hertz, instead of ppm. **Note:** this value will be subtracted from the center
frequency, so if your receiver tunes a bit too low, the parameter value shall be negative:

        ./dumpvdl2 --mirisdr 0 --gain 100 --correction -2500

Device serial number can be given instead of ID, the same way, as for RTLSDR receivers.

`libmirisdr-4` supports two types of hardware: generic Mirics (0 - the default) and SDRPlay (1).
SDRPlay users should add `--hw-type 1` option. It uses frequency plans optimized for SDRPlay
and reportedly gives better results than the default mode.

If you get error messages about lost samples on Raspberry Pi, try adding `--usb-mode 1`.
This switches USB transfer mode from isochronous to bulk, which is usually enough to rectify
this problem. If it does not help, it might be that your Pi is overloaded or not beefy enough
for the task. Try reducing the number of decoded VDL2 channels as a workaround. See also the
FAQ section "CPU usage on Raspberry Pi is very high" below.

##### SDRPLAY RSP native driver

SDRPlay RSP native driver supports several advanced configuration options:

- switching antenna ports (RSP2 only)
- bias-T (RSP2 only)
- notch filter on AM/FM (RSP2 only)
- Automatic Gain Control

Type `./dumpvdl2 --help` to find out all the options and their default values.

SDRPlay driver has a concept of "gain reduction", which is an amount of gain (in decibels)
which shall be deducted from the maximum gain. As a result, `--gain` option is not available
with this driver - use `--gr` option to specify requested end-to-end gain reduction instead.
The smallest possible value is 20. The highest value depends on receiver type, but it's
not that important, because in dumpvdl2 you will hardly be using a GR larger than 59 dB.

Another way to go is to skip the `--gr` option altogether. This will enable Automatic Gain
Control with a default set point of -35 dBFS, which shall converge to a reasonable gain
reduction value in a couple of seconds after the program starts. AGC set point can be changed
with `--agc` option, but treat this as an "expert mode" knob, which is hardly ever needed.

Example 1: use SDRplay device ID=0, with auto gain and three VDL2 channels:

        ./dumpvdl2 --sdrplay 0 136975000 136875000 136775000

Example 2: use SDRplay device with serial number 35830222, set gain reduction to 40 dB,
use antenna A port, disable Bias-T, enable AM/FM notch filter, set frequency correction to -1ppm:

        ./dumpvdl2 --sdrplay 35830222 --gr 40 --correction -1 --antenna A --biast 0 --notch-filter 1 136975000

### Output options

- Decoded messages are printed to standard output by default. You can direct them to a
  disk file instead:

        ./dumpvdl2 --output-file vdl2.log [other_options]

- If you want the file to be automatically rotated on top of every hour, add `--hourly` option.
  The file name will be appended with `_YYYYMMDDHH` suffix. If file extension is present, it
  will be placed after the suffix.

- If you prefer daily rotation, `--daily` option does just that. The file name suffix will be
  `_YYYYMMDD` in this case. If file extension is present, it will be placed after the suffix.

- Add `--utc` option if you prefer UTC timestamps rather than local timezone in output and filenames.

- Add `--raw-frames` option to display payload of AVLC frames in raw hex for debugging purposes.

- Add `--dump-asn1` option to display full ASN.1 structure dumps of CPDLC and CM messages.

### Integration with Planeplotter

dumpvdl2 can send ACARS messages to Planeplotter, which in turn can extract aircraft position
information from them and display blips on the map. First, configure your Planeplotter as follows:

- Stop data processing (press 'Stop' button on the toolbar)

- Go to Options / I/O Settings...

- Tick 'UDP/IP Data from net'

- Set 'UDP/IP local port' to some value (default is 9742)

- Close the settings window by clicking OK and restart data processing

Supply dumpvdl2 with the address (or host name) and port where the Planeplotter is listening:

        ./dumpvdl2 --output-acars-pp 10.10.10.12:9742 [other_options]

That's all. Switch to 'Message view' in Planeplotter and look for incoming messages.

### Message filtering

By default dumpvdl2 logs all decoded messages. You can use `--msg-filter` option to ignore
things you don't want to see. If you do not want messages sent by ground stations, run
the program like this:

        ./dumpvdl2 --msg-filter all,-uplink [other_options]

Or if you want to filter out empty ACARS messages, because they are boring, use this:

        ./dumpvdl2 --msg-filter all,-acars_nodata [other_options]

For full list of supported filtering options, run:

        ./dumpvdl2 --msg-filter help

Refer to `FILTERING_EXAMPLES.md` file for more examples and details.

### Statistics

The program does not calculate statistics by itself. Instead, it sends metric values (mostly
counters) to the external collector using Etsy StatsD protocol. It's the collector's job
to receive, aggregate, store and graph them. Some examples of software which can be used
for this purpose:

- [Collectd](https://collectd.org/) is a statistics collection daemon which supports a lot of
  metric sources by using various [plugins](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Table_of_Plugins).
  It has a [StatsD](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:StatsD) plugin which can receive
  statistics emitted by dumpvdl2, aggregate them and write to various time-series databases
  like RRD, Graphite, MongoDB or TSDB.

- [Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/) is a time-series database with powerful analytics and
  aggregation functions. Its graphing engine is quite basic, though.

- [Grafana](http://grafana.org/) is a sophisticated and elegant graphing solution supporting
  a variety of data sources.

Here is an example of some dumpvdl2 metrics being graphed by Grafana:

![Statistics](statistics.png?raw=true)

Metrics are quite handy when tuning the antenna installation or receiving parameters (like gain
or correction). Full list of currently supported counters can be found in `statsd.c` source file.
dumpvdl2 produces a separate set of counters for each configured VDL2 channel.

To enable statistics just give dumpvdl2 your StatsD collector's hostname (or IP address)
and UDP port number, for example:

        ./dumpvdl2 --statsd 10.10.10.15:1234 [other_options]

### Processing recorded IQ data from file

The syntax is:
```
dumpvdl2 --iq-file <file_name> [--sample-format <sample_format>] [--oversample <oversample_rate>]
  [--centerfreq <center_frequency>] [vdl_freq_1] [vdl_freq_2] [...]
```
The symbol rate for VDL2 is 10500 symbols/sec. dumpvdl2 internal processing rate is 10 samples
per symbol. Therefore the file must be recorded with sampling rate set to an integer multiple
of 105000. Specify the multiplier value with `--oversample` option. The default value is 10, which is
valid for files sampled as 1050000 samples/sec. For example, if you have recorded your file at
2100000 samples/sec, then use `--oversample 20` (because 105000 * 20 = 2100000).

The program accepts raw data files without any header. Files produced by `rtl_sdr` and `miri_sdr`
programs are perfectly valid input files. Different radios produce samples in different formats,
though. dumpvdl2 currently supports following sample formats:

- `U8` - unsigned 8-bit samples. This is the format produced by `rtl_sdr` utility.
- `S16_LE` - 16-bit signed, little endian. Produced by `miri_sdr` utility (by default).

Use `--sample-format` option to set the format. The default format is `U8`.

The program assumes that the VDL2 channel is located at baseband (0 Hz), ie. the center
frequency of your radio was set to the VDL2 channel frequency during recording. If this is not
the case, you have to provide correct center frequency and channel frequency. For example, if your
receiver was tuned to 136.955 MHz during recording and you want to decode the VDL2 channel
located at 136.975 MHz, then use this:

        dumpvdl2 --iq-file <file_name> --centerfreq 136955000 136975000

Putting it all together:

        dumpvdl2 --iq-file iq.dat --sample-format S16_LE --oversample 13 --centerfreq 136955000 136975000 136725000

processes `iq.dat` file recorded at 1365000 samples/sec using 16-bit signed samples, with receiver
center frequency set to 136.955 MHz. VDL2 channels located at 136.975 and 136.725 MHz will be decoded.

### Launching dumpvdl2 in background on system boot

There is an example systemd unit file in `etc` subdirectory (which means you need a systemd-based
distribution, like Debian/Raspbian Jessie or newer).

First, go to dumpvdl2 source directory and install the binary to `/usr/local/bin`:

        sudo make install

Copy the unit file to the systemd unit directory:

        sudo cp etc/dumpvdl2.service /etc/systemd/system/

Copy the example environment file to `/etc/default` directory:

        sudo cp etc/dumpvdl2 /etc/default/

Edit `/etc/default/dumpvdl2` with a text editor (eg. nano). Uncomment the `DUMPVDL2_OPTIONS=`
line and put your preferred dumpvdl2 option set there. Example:

        DUMPVDL2_OPTIONS="--rtlsdr 0 --gain 39 --correction 0 --output-file /home/pi/vdl2.log --daily 136975000 136875000 136775000"

Reload systemd configuration:

        sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Start the service:

        sudo systemctl start dumpvdl2

Verify if it's running:

        systemctl status dumpvdl2

It should show: `Active: active (running) since <date>`. If it failed, it might be due to an
error in the `DUMPVDL2_OPTIONS` value. Read the log messages in the status output and fix
the problem.

If everything works fine, enable the service, so that systemd starts it automatically at boot:

        systemctl enable dumpvdl2

### decpdlc

dumpvdl2 can decode FANS-1/A CPDLC messages. They are embedded in ACARS as hex strings:

        [2017-03-04 20:47:12] [136.975] [-18.8/-47.0 dBFS] [28.1 dB]
        10A41A (Ground station, On ground) -> 78100B (Aircraft): Command
        AVLC type: I sseq: 6 rseq: 6 poll: 0
        ACARS:
        Reg: .B-7898 Flight:
        Mode: 2 Label: AA Blk id: G Ack: ! Msg no.:
        Message:
        /AKLCDYA.AT1.B-7898A11EF285326CC0E4DAA48E1D2AB269C5410E6499B0904E9F5104199327D78B110499C8275AB53D04693480958A

The second field in the message (`.AT1`) indicates that this is a CPDLC message (other
message types which also contain CPDLC are: `.CR1`, `.CC1`, and `.DR1`). The above message
is decoded as follows:

        FANS-1/A CPDLC Message:
        CPDLC Uplink Message:
         Header:
          Msg ID: 2
          Timestamp: 07:47:10
         Message data:
          CLIMB TO AND MAINTAIN [altitude]
           Flight level: 340
          REPORT LEVEL [altitude]
           Flight level: 340
          [freetext]
           CRUISE CLIMB NOT ALLOWED IN NZZO FIR

ACARS messages can be conveyed over various radio links - POA (Plain Old ACARS over VHF),
AoA (ACARS over AVLC over VDL-2), HFDL (High Frequency Data Link) or SATCOM (Inmarsat,
Iridium). `dumpvdl2` only deals with VDL-2 radio link, however the FANS-1/A message format
is common, regardless of physical link used for transmission. So if you monitor ACARS,
HFDL or Inmarsat, you may wonder how to decode messages received on these links.

`decpdlc` is a small utility included in `dumpvdl2` source tree which uses dumpvdl2's
FANS-1/A decoder to decode CPDLC messages supplied manually from command line or from a file.

Steps:

- Clone the `dumpvdl2` repository (https://github.com/szpajder/dumpvdl2.git) or download
a stable release package from [here](https://github.com/szpajder/dumpvdl2/releases)
and unpack it.

- Go to the source directory and build the program:

        cd dumpvdl2
        make decpdlc

- After a while you should have `decpdlc` binary in the current directory. Run:

        ./decpdlc -h

for further instructions.

### Frequently Asked Questions

##### What is VDL Mode 2?

VDL (VHF Data Link) Mode 2 is a communication protocol between aircraft and a network of ground
stations. It has a higher capacity than ACARS and a lot more applications. More information
can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHF_Data_Link) or
[SigIdWiki](http://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/VHF_Data_Link_-_Mode_2_(VDL-M2)).

##### Who uses it?

Civil airlines - not all, but many. Military? Umm, no.

##### What frequencies it runs on?

The most ubiquitous is 136.975 MHz (so called Common Signalling Channel). In some areas where
the capacity of a single channel is not enough, 136.725, 136.775 or 136.875 is used as well.
Because they are closely spaced, dumpvdl2 can receive all of them simultaneously with a single
receiver.

##### Is it used in my area?

Yup, it's quite probable. Launch your favorite SDR Console (like SDRSharp or GQRX), tune
136.975 MHz and place your antenna outside (or near the window, at least). If you see short
bursts every now and then, it's there.

##### What antenna shall I use?

VDL2 runs on VHF airband, so if you already have a dedicated antenna for ACARS or airband voice,
it will be perfect for VDL2. However VDL2 transmissions are not very powerful, so do not expect
thousands of messages per hour, if your antenna is located indoors. If you have already played
with ADS-B, you know, what to do - put the antenna outside and high with unobstructed sky view,
use short and good quality feeder cable, shield your radio from external RF interference.

##### Two hours straight and zero messages received. What's wrong?

It basically comes down to three things:

###### The signal has to be strong enough (preferably 15 dB over noise floor, or better)

- set your tuner gain quite high. I get good results with 40 dB for RTLSDR and 75 dB for Mirics
  dongles. Do not be tempted to crank the gain up to the max. Keep your noise floor low
  because higher noise yields higher bit error rate and may cause signal clipping when the
  transmission is strong (eg. the transmitting aircraft is just overflying your antenna).
  On SDRPlay it should be good enough to use auto gain control.

- check SDR Console with the same gain setting - do you see data bursts clearly? (they are
  very short, like pops).

- if your DC spike is very high, set the center frequency manually to dodge it (use `--centerfreq`
  option).

- RTL dongles are cheap - some of them have higher noise figure than others. If you have several
  dongles at hand, just try another one.

###### Channel frequency must be correct

- initially, just don't set it manually, use the default of 136.975 MHz. It is used everywhere
  where VDL2 is deployed.

###### PPM correction setting must be (more or less) accurate

- oscillators in cheap receivers are not 100% accurate. It is usually necessary to introduce
  manual correction to get precise tuning. There is no one-size-fits-all correction value - it is
  receiver-specific. See next question.

##### How do I estimate PPM correction value for my dongle?

**Method 1:** use `rtl_test` utility which comes with `librtlsdr` library. Run it with `-p` option and
observe the output:

        root@linux:~ # rtl_test -p

After a couple of minutes the cumulative PPM value converges to a stable reading. This is
an approximate correction value for your dongle. Run dumpvdl2 with `--correction <value>`
option. dumpvdl2 can compensate correction errors up to a certain amount. Once you have
received some messages, look for the frequency offset field which is printed in the header
of each message (it's the value expressed in ppm). Your tuning is good, when this value
is close to 0.  If you see a systematic offset from 0, tweak your correction value to
compensate it.

##### High CPU usage on Raspberry Pi

Default compiler flags should work fine on most platforms. However you may get a performance
boost (read: lower CPU usage) by adjusting the flags to the CPU which you intend to run
dumpvdl2 on.

dumpvdl2 has predefined knobs for three flavours of Raspberries:

        make PLATFORM=rpiv1 (or rpiv2 or rpiv3)

Using a recent version of GCC is important as well. Version 4.9 (supplied with Raspbian
Jessie) is ancient and generates suboptimal code for ARM platforms. 6.3 (available in
Raspbian Stretch) or 7.1 (available in Arch Linux) both perform significantly better.

##### What do these numbers in the message header mean?

        [2017-02-26 19:18:00 GMT] [136.975] [-18.9/-43.9 dBFS] [25.0 dB] [0.4 ppm]

From left to right:

- date and time with timezone.

- channel frequency on which the message has been received.

- signal power level (averaged over all symbol sampling points in the burst). Full scale is 0 dB.

- noise floor power level. Full scale is 0 dB.

- signal to noise ratio (ie. signal power level minus noise floor power level).

- frequency offset of the received burst from the channel center frequency, in parts per million.

There is an `--extended-header` command line option which enables additional fields:

        [2017-02-26 19:18:00 GMT] [136.975] [-18.9/-43.9 dBFS] [25.0 dB] [0.4 ppm] [S:0] [L:34] [F:0] [#0]

- number of bit errors corrected in the VDL2 burst header (up to 2).

- burst length in octets.

- number of octets corrected by Reed-Solomon FEC.

- number of frame in this particular transmission. Multiple AVLC frames (messages) may be
  concatenated and sent as a single transmission burst. When a multiframe burst is received, frames
  will be numbered incrementally.

##### Can you add support for [*my favourite SDR receiver type*]?

Maybe. However do not expect me to purchase all SDRs available on the market just to make
dumpvdl2 work with them. If your life absolutely depends on it, consider donating, or at least
lending me the hardware for some time for development and testing.

Alternatively, if you can write code, you may do the work by yourself and submit it as a pull
request. Most of the program code is hardware-agnostic anyway. Adding new device type basically
comes down to the following:

- `dumpvdl2.c`, `dumpvdl2.h` - add new input type and necessary command line options.

- `rtl.c`, `rtl.h` - this is the code specific to the RTLSDR hardware. Make a copy and modify
  it to use the API of your SDR device. Or you can start off from `mirics.c` and `mirics.h`,
  if you prefer.

- `demod.c` - if your SDR device uses a sample format other than 8-bit unsigned and 16-bit
  signed, it is necessary to write a routine which handles this format and converts the samples
  to signed float in the <-1;1> range. Refer to `process_buf_uchar()` and `process_buf_short()`
  routines for details.

- `Makefile` - add new WITH_*DEVICE* compile time option and your new source files, add
  necessary `LDLIBS`, etc.

##### Can you add support for Windows?

To be honest, I don't use Windows very often and I don't know the programming intricacies of
this OS. However, if you feel like you could port the code and maintain the port later on,
please do so. Pull requests welcome.
